# PenTestCSRFexcercise

To run this excercise we need PHP, MySQL and any server, I have chosen Apache.

We will need to create the database named registratoion and a table in it named users.

The table can be created using 

CREATE TABLE `users` (
  `id` int(11) NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
  `username` varchar(100) NOT NULL,
  `email` varchar(100) NOT NULL,
  `password` varchar(100) NOT NULL
);

This application is vulnearble to CSRF, XSS, SQLinjection and password exfiltration attacks.

I have used pre-installed PHP, mysql and apche server on a MacOS X to build this.
